    <h2>Bitcoin Motion Graphic</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">In this motion graphic, I wrote and created all elements used (other than the voice over, which I paid for with Bitcoin!). It is largely based off of a talk by Andreas Antonopoulos on the revolutionary technology behind the currency of Bitcoin and its derivative cryptocurrencies.</p>
