      <h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">
        <b>Web Developer:</b> I developed custom internal and external applications for business optimization.
        <br>
        <b>Digital Designer:</b> I designed assets for the website, email, social, and other marketing efforts.
        <br>
        <b>Marketing Specialist:</b> I designed, coded, and wrote hundreds of marketing emails and I created, ran, evaluated and improved ad campaigns.
        <br>
        <b>Project Manager:</b> I held vendors accountable for timelines and ensured projects stayed on track and were successful.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">I've helped increase the email lists of Lehigh Outfitters, Lehigh Safety Shoes, and SlipGrips significantly (many times over) and email marketing revenue by roughly <span class="num">200%</span> year over year through automated email programs, defined campaigns and promotions, and a focus on improving the quantity (by sending approximately <span class="num">2</span> custom emails per week, per brand) and quality of the overall program. With a relatively small team, I was responsible for helping plan, setup, create, execute, and reflect on the email programs.</p>

      <p class="flow-text">The websites saw an increase in both conversion rates and revenue compared to the previous year. I contributed to these advancements through improved web experiences, optimal lead generation, and effective design.</p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        I worked with the other Front End Developers and Brand Managers to create and curate a cohesive style guide in an effort to create consistency, ADA compliance, and mitigate design confusion. This was a vital document for current and future developers or others working with the company's digital resources.
