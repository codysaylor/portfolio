    <h2>Business Website Development</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">This project was for New Era Broadband, a local internet, phone, and other digital service provider business. Since it's an informational website, I chose to use VuePress, a static site generator built with Vue.js.</p>

      <h2>Website Requirements</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Fortunately I work with the business owner at my full time job at Ohio University, so he and I already had a good working relationship and were able to discuss what he needed out of his website redesign. Dave primarily wanted a refreshed website which featured his new services. It would still remain an informational website but since he plans to launch new services, wanted a site to match.</p>
      <h2>Home page</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">The home page features most of the new designs and information. Again, this was meant to be a simple site which shows the services he provides as an internet and digital service provider. It features internet, phone, business, digital connections, testimonials, contact information, and an 'about' section.</p>

      <h2>The stack</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Since the New Era Broadband website didn't need to be fancy with database queries, it was a perfect candidate for a static site generator. As of 2018, my current website uses Jekyll and I have been a huge fan of the simplicity they provide while remaining powerful with other services to extend functionality when required (comments, forms, CMS, etc.). I chose to use VuePress (SSG), Forestry.io (CMS), CloudFlare (CDN, SSL provider), GitLab (hosting).</p>
      <p class="flow-text">Using these types of tools simplifies the whole process of creating and managing a website while retaining much of the power from a more complicated setup such as WordPress without paying any additional fees. Considering the traffic, the providers listed offer a free tier which fits perfectly for our use case.</p>
      <p class="flow-text">VuePress has been a great developer experience for those familiar with Vue.js and static site generators and I've used the other providers in the past with no problem. By keeping a simple stack, you lend yourself more time and flexibility when it comes to creating the website and displaying the information.</p>
