      <h2>Developing Reusable Components for OHIO</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">I have created a majority of the reusable components / elements used on OHIO's web CMS platform, Drupal. I accomplished this while working through other tasks such as bug fixes or website builds by communicating and collaborating with client and designers. During this work, I maintained brand standards, ensured accessibility, made elements versatile enough to be reused, and met client requirements.</p>
      <p class="flow-text"><b>Topic Previews:</b> Topic previews are versatile components allowing users to optionally showcase an image, heading, descriptive text, and provide a link to another page.</p>

      <p class="flow-text"><b>Image Tiles:</b> The image tile component offers a reusable and repeatable way for contributors to highlight photographs which represent content on their site.</p>

      <p class="flow-text"><b>Icon Tiles:</b> Icon tiles provide visual interest to a group of links with the use of Font Awesome icons.</p>

      <p class="flow-text">Explore Tabs: The explore more tabs element, initially created for the College of Fine Arts, offers a visually interesting way to direct attention.</p>
