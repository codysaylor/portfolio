    <p class="flow-text">After migrating away from a legacy CMS, we were able to create a new foundation on Drupal 8 - including newly designed and WCAG accessible components.</p>

      <h2>Migrating To Drupal</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">There are over 200 web properties under the ohio.edu domain that we've moved into a more modern and open content management system for our hundreds of contributors: Drupal 8.</p>
      <p class="flow-text">The team used this migration project as an opportunity to redesign the Ohio University web platform to create a consistent, modern looking website across the different departments. In collaboration with the UCM (University Communications and Marketing) team to create a standardized, brand consistent, web platform.</p>
      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">It is imperative to ensure websites are accessible to as many users as possible for <a href="https://codysaylor.com/notes/accessibility/">a variety of reasons</a>, but primarily because usability and accessibility go hand in hand. This is no different for ohio.edu, but there is also higher scrutiny placed on our product since it is in the public sector, so everything I write is accessible under WCAG's AA standard.</p>
      <h2>Developing Reusable Components for OHIO</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">I have created a majority of the reusable components / elements used on OHIO's web CMS platform, Drupal and have learned a lot along the way. I was able to accomplish this while working through other tasks such as bugfixes or website builds by communicating and collaborating with client and designers. We were able to maintain brand standards, ensure accessibility, are reusable, and meet client requirements.</p>
