    <p class="flow-text">While migrating roughly 200 properties away from a legacy CMS at Ohio University, I was instrumental in creating a new foundation on Drupal 8, developing new and WCAG accessible components.</p>

      <h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">
        <b>Web Developer:</b> I developed most of the components used in the CMS today following brand guidelines and web standards.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Twig, and the Drupal CMS, I developed over 20 branded, accessible, and versatile components for the Ohio University element library. I accomplished this while working through other tasks such as bug fixes or website builds by communicating and collaborating with clients, designers, and other stakeholders. During this work, I made elements dynamic enough to be reused throughout the site in order to maximize resource efficiency, align brand consistency, and meet client requirements on an enterprise level.</p>

      <p class="flow-text"><b>Topic Previews:</b> I developed topic previews to be versatile components allowing users to optionally showcase an image, heading, descriptive text, and provide a link to another page.</p>
      <img src="/assets/image-tiles.png" alt="image tile components"  class="responsive-img">
      <p class="flow-text"><b>Image Tiles:</b> I created the image tile component to offer a reusable and repeatable way for contributors to highlight photographs which represent content on their site.</p>

      <img src="/assets/icon-tiles.png" alt="icon tile components"  class="responsive-img">
      <p class="flow-text"><b>Icon Tiles:</b> I coded icon tiles to provide visual interest to a group of links with the use of Font Awesome icons.</p>

      <p class="flow-text"><b>Explore Tabs:</b> I developed the explore more tabs element, initially specificially for the College of Fine Arts, to offer a visually interesting way to strategically direct attention.</p>
