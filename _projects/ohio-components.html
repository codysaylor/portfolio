      <h2>Developing Reusable Components for OHIO</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">I have created a majority of the reusable components / elements used on OHIO's web CMS platform, Drupal. I accomplished this while working through other tasks such as bug fixes or website builds by communicating and collaborating with client and designers. During this work, I maintained brand standards, ensured accessibility, made elements versatile enough to be reused, and met client requirements.</p>
