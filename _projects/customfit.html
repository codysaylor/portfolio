      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Lehigh CustomFit is the business-to-business portion of Rocky Brands, making it a large source of revenue and a prioritized property. I contributed heavily towards their digital innovation through improved digital marketing campaigns by drafting engaging content, analyzing metrics through Google Analytics UTM tracking and Facebook analytics, and A/B testing emails.</p>
      <p class="flow-text">I initiated, planned, and executed a website redesign which corresponded with the brand guidelines. The new design modernized and improved overall user trust and experience. I was also responsible for updating the previous iteration of the website. I designed and developed an interactive SVG map with vue.js which allows users to easily find their representatives based on their location. I also made it simple to update if regions or representation change.</p>
