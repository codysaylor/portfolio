      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">To avoid unnecessary resource usage, we encourage clients to utilize existing elements, but there are certainly instances which require additional innovation. Since we didn't have any that highlighted images during the College of Fine Art's website migration and creation, I helped implement and guide discussion around new features.</p>
