      <p class="flow-text">
        <b>Project Manager:</b> I ensured the migration and any associated tasks by colleagues were done on schedule.
        <br>
        <b>Lead Developer:</b> Working with a designer, I developed all new required features and deligated tasks to other developers.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">The College of Fine Arts client required more visually dense elements than previously offered in order to highlight their programs. I developed and guided discussion around new elements and features including accordion style expanding tabs, video and image galleries, featured media, and a dynamic form embed.</p>
