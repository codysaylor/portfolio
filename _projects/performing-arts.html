    <p class="flow-text">The performing arts website required a way to promote and showcase upcoming shows and events at Ohio University. I implemented a design which offers a detail list and a thumbnail / gallery view.</p>

      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">The browse and filter component created specifically for performing arts was intended to highlight the event's cover art and any pertinent details about the event. I provided two layout options so users could use larger thumbnails or the detailed view if they preferred. There's also the option to filter by the start and end dates.</p>
