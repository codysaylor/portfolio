  <div class="scene-element wrapper container">
    <p class="flow-text">The Performing Arts website required a way to promote and showcase upcoming shows and events at Ohio University that would be competitive with major theaters. I developed and built a design which offers both a detailed list and a thumbnail view.</p>

      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">I created the event browse and filter component specifically for Performing Arts to highlight the event's cover art and any pertinent details. Both the filter features and the layout options allow for a customized and efficient user experience. Users can filter by dates, event category, and venue. I also created a featur event section for the home page that further emphasizes key events for the client.</p>
