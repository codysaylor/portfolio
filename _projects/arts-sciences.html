    <p class="flow-text">With over 3500 pages, the Ohio University College of Arts & Sciences site was one of the largest and most complex websites to migrate from into a new CMS and build.</p>

      <h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">
        <b>Project Manager:</b> I managed the migration and development tasks and monitored staff resources. I also ensured any associated tasks by vendors were done on schedule.
        <br>
        <b>Lead Developer:</b> Working with a designer, I developed all new required features and facilitated the migration and build.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">I handled the vast majority of this large-scale migration, including gathering requirements, client communication, delegation, implementation, and developing new elements. Some elements that I made include a dynamic weather interface, RSS feeds, and integration with 3rd party services such as Acalog.</p>
